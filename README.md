intelligent MRI machine: disease predection and screeningÂ¶ general presentation of the project Following an absence of medication for certain diseases, it is always necessary to provide them at a precausal stage in order to increase the chances of recovery. This is why we thought of creating a Detection and screening model from imaging for example if a patient consults a rheumatologist for a skull fracture and the latter recommends an MRI our program is able to detect a tumor at the level of the brain if it exists. Not only that, MRIs do not generally provide all the information sufficient to make the diagnosis! Our program will lend a hand to help:  The radiologist: to recommend a specialist medcin: for a better diagnosis patient: for early detection of illness  that's why we collected a dataset from several datasets such as brain-tumor, alzheimer, covid_19, chest tumor (due to the time constraint we just collected a dataset of MRI images of 4 different types of disease but we can give a huge database of all diseases since the algorithm has shown these performances) so that the MRI can detect all types of diseases in an automatic way so a patient will be able to make a general diagnosis without the intervention of the doctor after a few minutes.  then we built the deep learning model based on CNN then we built the human machine interface which will be implemented on the MRI scanner
